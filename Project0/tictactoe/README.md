# tictactoe
![example](Project0\tictactoe\example.gif)
Implemented a tic-tac-toe AI using the **minimax algorithm**, incorporating **alpha-beta pruning** for optimization. Without pruning, it takes longer to run, especially when the AI goes first.

## Usage
run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` before run runner.py.

```$ python runner.py```
